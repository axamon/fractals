fractals
========

Line-based fractal generator.

**general concept**

These fractals are generated by successively transforming an initial set of lines. A transformer function takes a single line and returns possibly many new lines. In each stage, we transform all lines in the current generation resulting in a new, usually larger set of lines. A line is defined by its start point, end point, width, and "done" value. When a line's done flag is set, that means we no longer transform it in following iterations. 

**implemented transformes**

There are two example transformers in transformers.go. First, is the equilateral transformer which notches an equilateral triangle 1/3 of the way through the line:

![equilateral ex 1](png/equal_ex1.png "Equal ex 1")
![equilateral ex 2](png/equal_ex2.png "Equal ex 2")

Next is the tree transformer which branches each line with a bit of randomness in terms of angle and length. After a line is branched, the "done" flag is set so that it is not modified in future iterations.

![tree ex 1](png/equal_ex1.png "Tree ex 1")
![tree ex 2](png/equal_ex2.png "Tree ex 2")

**usage**

```go
import (
  "github.com/emef/fractals"
)

// create initial shape, just a triangle
lines := []fractals.Line{
		fractals.NewLine(0, 0, 500, 0, 2.0),
		fractals.NewLine(500, 0, 100, 50, 2.0),
		fractals.NewLine(100, 50, 0, 0, 2.0)}
		
// fractal object, will transform each line according to EquilateralTransformer in each step
f := fractals.New(fractals.EquilateralTransformer, lines)

// advance 8 iterations
f.Next(8)

// save fractal to png
f.ToFile("png/equal_fractal.png")
```
